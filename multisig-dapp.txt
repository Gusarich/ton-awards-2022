1. Multisig dApp
2. dApp to interact with Multi-Signature wallets on TON
3. All functional is complete (except for ton connnect 2.0 support). It was manually tested (not fully)
4. https://github.com/Gusarich/multisig-dapp
5. Daniil Sedov (@Gusarich) and Michael Andreev (@Miandic)
6. Several weeks, but it could have been done a lot faster (we weren't experienced in TON at the start of development)
7. Add ton connect 2.0 as soon as they allow signing of custom data; rework some parts of code; use our other development https://github.com/puppycats/multisig instead of raw work with cells
8. It would be cool if a TF designer would make a nice design for us, and we would implement it
9. 550 TON from TF
